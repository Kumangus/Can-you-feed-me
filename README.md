# Can-you-feed-me

The "Can you feed me?" mobile app is a tool for decision makers and the general public to understand the self-sufficiency of their country across decades and under fluctuating market conditions. It was built to withstand global demand and supply data. When the app is fully connected to high resolution global croplands and pasture databases, it can zoom into local areas and find their strategic self-sufficient perimeter which a community would need to sustain should imports or exports fluctuate. 

This project is solving the Food Directions challenge.
Description
Overview: This app attempts to bring awareness to the simple question, can you be fed? The UN calculates that with the current global food store, everyone COULD be fed.

This is based on your location (country-level) and the amount of food actually available (not how it is dispersed). The possibility of being fed, Yes or No, is calculated on the potential food stores of the current trade and production, as well as if there are no imports.

GOAL: Bring awareness to large amount of food stores and the possibility of everyone being fed.

STAKEHOLDERS/USERS: The FAO, from which the data is taken from, is involved for the amount of data used.

I can help educators and general public gain awareness of food stores and food availability.

It can be used as input into disaster and wartime scenarios to help officials prepare mitigation plans and identify strategic food sustainability perimeters.

TRENDS AND INSIGHT: Show the large amount of food wasted and improper distribution.

IDEAS: Can you be fed? YES OR NOT?

CONCEPT: Basically, visualize the amount of food available and the types if potentially all food was shared, and what food would be available with or without trade (import/export).
